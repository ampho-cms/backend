# Contributing to Ampho

First, thank you so much for wanting to contribute! It means so much that you care enough to want to contribute. We
appreciate every PR from the smallest of typos to the biggest of features.

Please open PRs against the `development` branch. **_DO NOT_** open one against `master` unless you are explicitly told
to. All "unreleased" work happens in the `development` branch.
