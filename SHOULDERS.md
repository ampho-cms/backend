# Ampho Stands on the Shoulders of Giants

Ampho does not try to reinvent the wheel! Instead, it uses the already great wheels developed by the Go community and
puts them all together in the best way possible. Without these giants, this project would not be possible. Please make
sure to check them out and thank them for all of their hard work.

Thank you to the following **GIANTS**:

* [Viper -- Go configuration with fangs](https://github.com/spf13/viper)
* [gorilla/mux -- a request router and dispatcher](https://github.com/gorilla/mux)
